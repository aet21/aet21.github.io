title: Epigenetic Mitotic Clocks for Cancer Risk Prediction

  - projects
introductions: "DNA methylation changes accrue in normal cells as a function of cell-division and have been shown by us and others to be reliable trackers of mitotic age (the **epiTOC, epiTOC2 and stemTOC clocks**). Mitotic age can be broadly defined as the cumulative number of stem-cell divisions in a tissue.  Interest in quantifying mitotic age derives from the observation that it constitutes a major cancer risk factor. Hence, in principle, mitotic clocks could be used for cancer risk prediction. However, here too, one main challenge is cell-type heterogeneity since single-cell DNAm data is still too sparse and costly, with hence most DNAm data having been generated in bulk-tissue which is a complex mixture of many cell-types. Thus, we are developing statistical methods to build cell-type specific mitotic clocks in the hope that these can deliver more accurate predictors of cancer-risk."
