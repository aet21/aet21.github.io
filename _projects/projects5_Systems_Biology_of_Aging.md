introductions: "In order to better understand how aging alters normal cellular function, we have developed machine learning methods to help elucidate systems biological aspect of the aging process. For instance, we used a transcription factor (TF) regulon based approach to generate the first map of age-associated TF activity changes at cell-type resolution in mouse, using scRNA-Seq data from the Tabula Muris Senis. We have also explored using graph convolutional neural networks to obtain novel insights into aging at both the mRNA and DNAm levels. We are continuing these lines of investigation"
