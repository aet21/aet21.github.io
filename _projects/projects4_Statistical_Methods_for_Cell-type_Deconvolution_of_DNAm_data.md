title: Statistical Methods for Cell-type Deconvolution of DNAm data
categories:
  - projects
introductions: "Given the significant challenge cell-type heterogeneity presents to the analysis and interpretation of DNAm data, over the years we have spent substantial effort in building cell-type deconvolution algorithms, not only for blood, but also for arbitrary solid tissue-types. In particular, we built the **EpiSCORE algorithm** and associated database of DNAm reference panels for 13 tissue-types. We are currently working on developing an improved version of EpiSCORE, as well as generalizing this database to additional human tissue-types, as well as to mouse, to allow cell-type deconvolution in solid tissues from mice"
