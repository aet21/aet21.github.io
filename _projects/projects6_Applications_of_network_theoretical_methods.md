title: Applications of network theoretical methods
categories:
  - projects
introductions: "We have a long-term interest in using tools from network physics to address computational/statistical challenges in the omic data field. For instance, we recently explored using cell-attribute aware community detection algorithms to detect differential abundance of cell-types in scRNA-Seq data (**ELVAR algorithm**). We have also pioneered the application of spin-glass community detection algorithms to identify network module joint epigenetic-transcriptomic biomarkers (**FEM algorithm**) for early detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We continue to explore network theoretical concepts"
