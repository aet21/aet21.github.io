title: Cancer Systems Biology at Single Cell Resolution
categories:
  - projects
introductions: "We are interested in using single-cell data (scRNA-Seq/snRNA-Seq) to elucidate systems biological principles of oncogenesis and to develop cancer risk prediction strategies at single-cell resolution. We have made substantial progress in coming up with the **CancerStemID algorithm** that allows identification of those cells in preneoplastic cell populations that are at higher cancer risk. Our collaborative work supports the view that DNA methylation changes are associated with epigenetic reprogramming and increased cellular plasticity in preneoplastic cell populations. From a more theoretical perspective we are exploring statistical mechanical approaches to building Waddington-like landscapes of the preneoplastic state, which could inform us about which cell-types are more likely to turn cancerous"
